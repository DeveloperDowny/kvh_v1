# About KAVACH 2023 & Our Win

We are thrilled to announce that our team, Team Semicolon, emerged triumphant at the prestigious Kavach 2023 Hackathon, a 36-hour cybersecurity challenge organized by the Government of India. Out of a staggering 3,900 participating teams, we were among the 106 shortlisted for the grand finale. <b><i>We clinched the 1st Prize in our bucket, securing a cash prize of 50,000 rupees!</i></b>

# About the Project

## For Investigators
- We were tasked with developing an Indigenous Cryptocurrency Investigation Tool, a solution to assist law enforcement bodies in India to combat cyber-crimes involving cryptocurrencies. Our tool uses tokenview.io APIs to fetch transaction details of given addresses. Through Open-Source Intelligence and custom ML models, we generate transaction graphs that help identify illicit transactions and wallets. We used MERN and Flask mini-server for integrating ML models.

- We also implemented a time-based OTP to improve security. Our tool doesn't just stop at analysis; it provides real-time monitoring of transactions and wallets, and even generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

## For Citizens
- We developed a comprehensive Citizen Portal aimed at educating citizens about cryptocurrencies and equipping them to report cryptocurrency-related cybercrimes. We also created a one-stop solution to assess the risks associated with a given wallet address. In addition to this, we also created a browser extension to identify malicious wallet addresses on any site you surf.
